# Cloud DevOps Automation with Terraform, Jenkins, and Git

This project demonstrates **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automation** using **Terraform** along with other DevOps tools like **Jenkins** and **Git**.  
The goal is to automate infrastructure provisioning, configuration, and CI/CD pipelines to enable faster, reliable, and repeatable deployments.

  - Provision AWS infrastructure (VPC, Security Groups, EC2, etc.)  
  - Manage dependencies with Terraform modules  
  - Version-locked providers (`.terraform.lock.hcl`)

- **Jenkins for CI/CD**  
  - Automates Terraform workflows (`init`, `plan`, `apply`)  
  - Integrates with Git to trigger builds on commits  
  - Provides visibility of deployments with build logs

- **Git for Version Control**
